# Overview of Multivariate Methods

When multivariate analysis is applicable?

Nature of measurement error and its impact

Techniques, guidelines, interpretation

Steps to multivariate model building

multivariate analysis -> influences -> data collection

## Key Terms

1. Type I and II errors

2. **Bivariate partial correlation**: correlation between two sets ...

3. **Bootstrapping**: validating a multivariate model by drawing a large number 
   of sub-samples and estimating models for each sub-sample

4. Dependence technique: regression analysis

5. Dependente variable, Independent variable, Dummy variable

6. Indicator, Interdependence technique

8. Measurement error, Specification error

9. Multicolliniarity: Extent to which a variable can be explained by the other variables in the analysis

10. **Power**: Probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false; that is, correctly finding a hypothesized relationship when it exists
    
11. Practical significance, Reliability, Validity, Variate

12. Metric data (quantitative data), Nonmetric data (qualitative data)

13. Univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA)

## What is Multivariate Analysis

- [X] Effective knowledge creation and management


> "We are drowning in information and starved for knowledge", Tom Peters

## Multivariate Analysis in Statistical Terms

- [X] Create knowledge and thereby improve their decision making

>### Multivariate analysis
> refers to all statistical techniques that simultaneously analyze multiple measurements on individuals or objects under investigation

## Some Basic Concepts of Multivariate Analysis

>### Roots
> univariate and bivariate statistics

### The Variate

> - building block of multivariate analysis
> - a linear combination of variables with empirically determined weights

Variate value $= w_1X_1 + w_2X_2 + \ldots + w_nX_n$ where $X_n$ is
the observed variable and $w_n$ is the weight determined by the
multivariate technique.

## Measurement Scales

> Data can be classified into one of two categories -- nonmetric, qualitative and metric, quantitative -- based on the type of attributes or characteristics they represent.

### Nonmetric Measurement Scales

Nonmetric data describe differences in ty or kind by indicating the presence or absence of a characteristic or property.

>### Nominal Scales
> assigns numbrs as a way to label or identify subjects or objects

>### Ordinal Scales
> "higher" level of measurement precision, variables can be ordered or ranked in relation to the amount of the attribute possessed
